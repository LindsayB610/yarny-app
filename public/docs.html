          <h2>Writing in the Editor</h2>
          
          <h3>Editor Interface</h3>
          <p>The editor has three main areas:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Left Rail (Story)</strong>: Your story structure with chapters, groups, and snippets</li>
            <li><strong>Center Canvas</strong>: The main writing area where you compose your content - all snippets open here</li>
            <li><strong>Right Rail (Snippets)</strong>: Your snippets organized by People, Places, and Things</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Resume Where You Left Off:</strong> When you open a story, the editor automatically opens to the snippet you were last editing, whether it's in a chapter or in People/Places/Things. This makes it easy to continue your work without having to navigate to find where you were.</p>

          <h3>Organizing Your Story</h3>
          <p>Yarny uses a flexible structure:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Groups</strong>: Major sections or chapters of your story</li>
            <li><strong>Snippets</strong>: Individual pieces of writing within a group</li>
            <li><strong>Tags</strong>: Organize snippets with custom tags for easy filtering</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Chapter Color Coding</h3>
          <p>You can color-code your chapters to visually organize your story:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Click the small colored square next to a chapter title</li>
            <li>A color picker will appear with 12 accent colors to choose from</li>
            <li>Select a color to apply it to that chapter</li>
            <li>The color is saved automatically and helps you visually distinguish between chapters</li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use different colors to represent different story arcs, character perspectives, or time periods.</p>

          <h3>Adding Content</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Click on a snippet or group to select it</li>
            <li>Start typing in the center editor</li>
            <li>Your changes are automatically saved to Google Drive</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Creating New Snippets</h3>
          <p>There are two types of snippets:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Chapter Snippets</strong>: Click the "+" button next to a group header to add a new snippet to that chapter. <strong>New snippets appear instantly</strong> - you can start typing right away while the Drive file is created in the background.</li>
            <li><strong>People/Places/Things Snippets</strong>: Click the "+ New Snippet" button in the right rail (or the "+" button in the tab header) to create a new snippet in the People, Places, or Things category.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All snippets open in the main editor window, providing a consistent editing experience. Your changes are automatically saved when you switch between snippets.</p>

          <h3>Creating New Chapters</h3>
          <p>Click the "New Chapter" button at the bottom of the story list to create a new group. New chapters are automatically assigned a color, but you can change it using the color picker.</p>
