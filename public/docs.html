          <p><strong>Note:</strong> You can edit your story's title, genre, description, and word goal later by clicking the settings icon (⚙️) next to "Story" in the left rail of the editor.</p>

          <h3>Story Cards</h3>
          <p>Each story card on the Stories page displays:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Story name</strong>: The title of your story</li>
            <li><strong>Last modified</strong>: When you last edited the story</li>
            <li><strong>Deadline</strong>: If you've set a deadline for your writing goal, it will be displayed on the story card (e.g., "Deadline: Dec 25, 2025")</li>

        <section class="docs-section" id="writing-in-the-editor">
          <h2>Writing in the Editor</h2>
          
          <h3>Editor Interface</h3>
          <p>The editor has three main areas:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Left Rail (Story)</strong>: Your story structure with chapters, groups, and snippets</li>
            <li><strong>Center Canvas</strong>: The main writing area where you compose your content - all snippets open here</li>
            <li><strong>Right Rail (Snippets)</strong>: Your snippets organized by People, Places, and Things</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Resume Where You Left Off:</strong> When you open a story, the editor automatically opens to the snippet you were last editing, whether it's in a chapter or in People/Places/Things. This makes it easy to continue your work without having to navigate to find where you were.</p>

          <h3>Organizing Your Story</h3>
          <p>Yarny uses a flexible structure:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Groups</strong>: Major sections or chapters of your story</li>
            <li><strong>Snippets</strong>: Individual pieces of writing within a group</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Chapter Color Coding</h3>
          <p>You can color-code your chapters to visually organize your story:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Click the small colored square next to a chapter title</li>
            <li>A color picker will appear with 12 accent colors to choose from</li>
            <li>Select a color to apply it to that chapter</li>
            <li>The color is saved automatically and helps you visually distinguish between chapters</li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use different colors to represent different story arcs, character perspectives, or time periods.</p>

          <h3>Adding Content</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Click on a snippet or group to select it</li>
            <li>Start typing in the center editor</li>
            <li>Your changes are automatically saved to Google Drive</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Creating New Snippets</h3>
          <p>There are two types of snippets:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Chapter Snippets</strong>: Click the "+" button next to a group header to add a new snippet to that chapter. <strong>New snippets appear instantly</strong> - you can start typing right away while the Drive file is created in the background.</li>
            <li><strong>People/Places/Things Snippets</strong>: Click the "+ New Snippet" button in the right rail (or the "+" button in the tab header) to create a new snippet in the People, Places, or Things category.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All snippets open in the main editor window, providing a consistent editing experience. Your changes are automatically saved when you switch between snippets.</p>

          <h3>Creating New Chapters</h3>
          <p>Click the "New Chapter" button at the bottom of the story list to create a new group. New chapters are automatically assigned a color, but you can change it using the color picker.</p>

          <h3>Reordering Chapters and Snippets</h3>
          <p>You can reorganize your story by dragging chapters and snippets:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Reorder Chapters:</strong> Click and drag a chapter header to move it to a new position. The new order is automatically saved to Google Drive.</li>
            <li><strong>Reorder Snippets:</strong> Click and drag a snippet within a chapter to reorder it, or drag it to a different chapter to move it. Changes are saved automatically.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Tip:</strong> When dragging, you'll see visual feedback highlighting valid drop targets. The order is saved automatically, so your organization persists across sessions.</p>

          <h3>Collapsing and Expanding Chapters</h3>
          <p>To focus on specific chapters while working, you can collapse chapters you're not currently using:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Click the collapse/expand button (arrow icon) on any chapter header</li>
            <li>The chapter will minimize, hiding its snippets</li>
            <li>Click again to expand and show the snippets</li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Collapse chapters 1, 2, and 3 while working on chapter 4 to reduce visual clutter. Your collapsed preferences are remembered when you return to the story.</p>

        <section class="docs-section" id="searching">
          <h2>Searching</h2>
          
          <p>Use the search box in the left rail to quickly find snippets by name or content. The search feature searches across all snippet titles and content, making it easy to find what you're looking for.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="docs-section" id="people-places-things">
          <h2>People, Places, and Things Snippets</h2>
          
          <h3>Snippet Categories</h3>
          <p>The right rail has three tabs for organizing snippets:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>People</strong>: Character notes, relationships, descriptions</li>
            <li><strong>Places</strong>: Location descriptions, settings, world-building details</li>
            <li><strong>Things</strong>: Objects, items, concepts, and other elements</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Creating and Editing Snippets</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Click on a snippet in the right rail to open it in the main editor</li>
            <li>Or click "+ New Snippet" to create a new snippet in the current category</li>
            <li>Type your content in the main editor window</li>
            <li>Snippets are automatically saved when you switch between them</li>
            <li>All snippets work the same way - whether they're in chapters or People/Places/Things</li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> All snippets (chapters and People/Places/Things) now open in the main editor window for a consistent editing experience. Your changes are automatically saved in the background when you switch between snippets.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="docs-section" id="exporting">
          <h2>Exporting Content</h2>
          
          <p>Yarny allows you to export your content as combined Google Docs. This is useful for creating compiled versions of your work, sharing with others, or creating backups.</p>
          
          <h3>Export Options</h3>
          <p>You can export content in five ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Export All Chapters</strong>: Combines all chapter snippets in the order they appear in the left rail into a single Google Doc</li>
            <li><strong>Export Outline</strong>: Creates a structured outline with chapter and snippet titles, plus any descriptions you've added (story description, chapter descriptions, and snippet descriptions). This is useful for creating a high-level overview of your story structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Export All People</strong>: Combines all People snippets into a single Google Doc</li>
            <li><strong>Export All Places</strong>: Combines all Places snippets into a single Google Doc</li>
            <li><strong>Export All Things</strong>: Combines all Things snippets into a single Google Doc</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>How to Export</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Open the story you want to export content from</li>
            <li>Click the "Export" button in the footer (left side)</li>
            <li>Select the export option you want (Chapters, People, Places, or Things)</li>
            <li>A dialog will appear with a suggested filename (e.g., "My Story - All Chapters")</li>
            <li>Edit the filename if desired, or use the suggested name</li>
            <li>Click "Export" to create the file</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h3>Export File Format</h3>
          <p>Exported files are created as Google Docs in your story folder in Google Drive. The content is formatted as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Chapter Exports</strong>: Chapter titles appear as main headings (#), snippet titles appear as subheadings (##), and snippet content follows in order</li>
            <li><strong>Outline Exports</strong>: Story description (if present) appears first, followed by chapter titles as main headings (#) with chapter descriptions (if present), then snippet titles as subheadings (##) with snippet descriptions (if present). Only titles and descriptions are included - no snippet body content.</li>
            <li><strong>People/Places/Things Exports</strong>: Snippet titles appear as subheadings (##), followed by snippet content, with separators between entries</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Export Location</h3>
          <p>All exported files are saved directly in your story folder in Google Drive, making them easy to find alongside your other story files.</p>
          
          <h3>Export Behavior</h3>
          <p>When exporting:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Content is combined in the order it appears in Yarny (based on snippet positions)</li>
            <li>Empty snippets are skipped</li>
            <li>The export button shows a loading state while the file is being created</li>
            <li>You'll see a success message when the export completes</li>
            <li>If an export fails, you'll see an error message with details</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> Exporting does not modify your original snippets - it creates new Google Doc files with combined content.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="docs-section" id="word-count-goals">
          <h2>Word Count and Goals</h2>
          
          <p>Yarny helps you track your writing progress with both project-level goals and daily writing targets. The left rail shows your overall progress, while the "Today" chip shows your daily progress toward your writing goal.</p>
          
          <h3>Project Word Count Goal</h3>
          <p>The goal meter in the left rail shows your total progress: "X / Y words" where Y is your project goal. The progress bar fills as you approach your target.</p>
          
          <p>To set or change your project word count goal:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Click on the goal meter in the left rail (shows "X / Y" where Y is your goal)</li>
            <li>This opens the Story Info & Settings modal</li>
            <li>Enter your desired word count goal in the "Word Count Goal" field</li>
            <li>Click "Save Changes" to update your goal</li>
          </ol>
          <p>You can also access this by clicking the settings icon (⚙️) next to the "Story" title in the left rail.</p>
          
          <h3>Daily Writing Goals</h3>
          <p>Yarny's "Goals that think" feature helps you break down your project goal into manageable daily targets. Set a deadline, choose which days you write, and Yarny automatically calculates your daily quota.</p>
          
          <h4>Setting Up a Daily Goal</h4>
          <p>To set up daily goal tracking:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Click the "Today" chip in the left rail (appears below the goal meter once you set a goal)</li>
            <li>Or click on the goal meter and then click "Today" chip if it appears</li>
            <li>In the Goal panel, enter:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Word Count Target</strong>: Your total project word count goal</li>
              <li><strong>Deadline</strong>: When you want to finish your project</li>
              <li><strong>Writing Days</strong>: Check the days of the week you typically write (Mon-Sun)</li>
              <li><strong>Days Off</strong>: Optional comma-separated dates when you won't write (e.g., "2025-12-25, 2026-01-01")</li>
              <li><strong>Mode</strong>: Choose between Elastic or Strict</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Click "Save Goal"</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h4>Goal Modes</h4>
          <p>Yarny offers two goal tracking modes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Elastic Mode</strong> (default): Automatically recalculates your daily target based on remaining words and remaining writing days. If you miss a day, tomorrow's target increases. If you write more than your target, future targets become easier.</li>
            <li><strong>Strict Mode</strong>: Uses a fixed daily target calculated from your total goal divided by total writing days. Shows "ahead" (green) or "behind" (red) status but doesn't change the target.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Today Chip</h4>
          <p>The "Today" chip in the left rail shows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Today • N</strong>: Your current word count for today</li>
            <li><strong>Micro-progress bar</strong>: Visual indicator of progress toward today's target</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The chip updates in real-time as you type. In Strict mode, the progress bar turns green when you're ahead and red when you're behind.</p>
          
          <h4>Dashboard Badge</h4>
          <p>On the Stories page, each story card shows a badge with your daily progress:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Today N · X days left</strong>: Shows today's word count and remaining writing days until your deadline</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This badge only appears if you've set up a daily goal for that story.</p>
          
          <h4>Midnight Rollover</h4>
          <p>At midnight (Pacific time), Yarny automatically:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Moves today's word count to the daily ledger</li>
            <li>Calculates tomorrow's target based on your mode and remaining work</li>
            <li>Resets the "Today" chip for the new day</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you're typing when midnight rolls over, Yarny handles the transition smoothly.</p>
          
          <h4>Editing Goals</h4>
          <p>To modify your goal settings:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Click the "Today" chip</li>
            <li>Update any settings (target, deadline, writing days, mode, days off)</li>
            <li>Click "Save Goal"</li>

          <p>Changes take effect immediately and recalculate your daily target.</p>
          
          <h4>Clearing Goals</h4>
          <p>To remove daily goal tracking:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Click the "Today" chip</li>
            <li>Click "Clear Goal"</li>
            <li>Confirm the action</li>
          </ol>
          <p>This removes all goal tracking data. Your project word count goal remains unchanged.</p>
          
          <h3>Footer Information</h3>
          <p>The footer shows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Current word count for the active snippet</li>
            <li>Character count for the active snippet</li>

          <h2>Google Drive Integration</h2>
          
          <h3>Automatic Saving</h3>
          <p>All your work is automatically saved to Google Drive. You'll see a "Saving..." or "Saved" indicator in the editor when changes are being synced.</p>

          <h3>Accessing Your Files</h3>
          <p>Your stories are stored in a folder called "Yarny Stories" in your Google Drive. You can access these files directly through Google Drive if needed.</p>

          <h3>Refreshing from Drive</h3>
          <p>Click the "↻ Refresh" button on the Stories page to sync any changes made outside of Yarny.</p>

          <h3>Exporting to Google Docs</h3>
          <p>Yarny includes export functionality that creates combined Google Docs from your content. See the <a href="#exporting">Exporting Content</a> section for details on how to export chapters, people, places, and things.</p>

          <h3>Comments and Tracked Changes Protection</h3>
          <div style="background: #FEF3C7; border-left: 4px solid #F59E0B; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; border-radius: var(--radius-sm);">
            <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 14px; color: #92400E;">
              <strong>⚠️ Important:</strong> Yarny preserves only the plain text content of your snippets. Comments and tracked changes (suggestions) in Google Docs are not preserved when saving from Yarny.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>If you've added comments or tracked changes to a snippet in Google Docs, Yarny will warn you before saving:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>When you try to save a snippet that has comments or tracked changes, a warning dialog will appear</li>
            <li>The warning shows how many comments and whether tracked changes are present</li>
            <li>You can choose to:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Cancel</strong>: Stops the save operation so you can open the document in Google Docs to resolve comments/tracked changes first</li>
                <li><strong>Save Anyway</strong>: Proceeds with the save, but comments and tracked changes will be permanently lost</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> If you've received collaborative feedback (comments or suggestions) on a snippet in Google Docs, resolve them in Google Docs before saving from Yarny to preserve the feedback.</p>

          <h2>Error Codes and Debugging</h2>
          
          <p>Yarny includes built-in error logging to help diagnose issues. If you encounter problems, you can access error logs through your browser's developer console.</p>
          
          <h3>Accessing Error Logs</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Open your browser's developer console (usually <code>F12</code> or <code>Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + I</code>)</li>
            <li>Type <code>viewYarnyErrors()</code> and press Enter</li>
            <li>A table of recent errors will be displayed, including timestamps, error types, and messages</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h3>Error Types</h3>
          <p>Yarny logs the following types of errors:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>console.error</strong>: Errors logged via console.error() - typically application errors</li>
            <li><strong>unhandledrejection</strong>: Unhandled promise rejections - async operation failures</li>
            <li><strong>error</strong>: Global JavaScript errors - runtime exceptions</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Clearing Error Logs</h3>
          <p>To clear the error log, type <code>clearYarnyErrors()</code> in the browser console.</p>
          
          <h3>Common Error Scenarios</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Drive API errors</strong>: Usually indicate authentication or permission issues with Google Drive</li>
            <li><strong>Network errors</strong>: Connection issues preventing saves to Drive</li>
            <li><strong>File not found errors</strong>: May occur if files were moved or deleted outside of Yarny</li>
            <li><strong>Conflict detection errors</strong>: Occurs when files are modified in Drive while being edited in Yarny</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you're reporting a bug, include the error log output from <code>viewYarnyErrors()</code> to help developers diagnose the issue.</p>
