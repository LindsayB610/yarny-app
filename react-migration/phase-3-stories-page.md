# Phase 3: Stories Page with Virtualization Stub (Week 2)

## Checklist
- [ ] Convert stories list to React components
- [ ] Implement search/filtering
- [ ] Add modals (new story, delete confirmation)
- [ ] Integrate with Drive API hooks
- [ ] Stub virtualized list capability (set up `@tanstack/react-virtual` infrastructure, even if not used yet)
- [ ] Test story management

## Deliverables
- React stories page with Drive-backed data, search/filter functionality, and modal workflows mirroring legacy behavior.
- Virtualization scaffolding in place to activate quickly if performance requires it in later phases.

## Level of Effort
- Estimated 10–14 hours including virtualization infrastructure setup.

## Risk Checkpoint Focus
- Re-rate editor/Docs round-tripping, Drive quotas, and large-scale performance risks.
- Establish baseline performance metrics prior to editor integration.

## Notes & References
- Validate search and modal behavior against classic UX anchors and smoke test checklist from Phase 1.
- Ensure virtualized list scaffolding aligns with performance targets recorded in `react-migration/overview.md`.
